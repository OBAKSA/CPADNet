## 📖Abstract
Recent deep learning-based image denoising methods have shown impressive performance; however, many lack the flexibility to adjust the denoising strength based on the noise levels, camera settings, and user preferences. In this paper, we introduce a new controllable denoising framework that adaptively removes noise from images by utilizing information from camera parameters. Specifically, we focus on ISO, shutter speed, and F-number, which are closely related to noise levels. We convert these selected parameters into a vector to control and enhance the performance of the denoising network. Experimental results show that our method seamlessly adds controllability to standard denoising neural networks and improves their performance.
